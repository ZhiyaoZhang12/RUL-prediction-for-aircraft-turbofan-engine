## Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction for Turbofan Engines considering time-varying operating conditions
RUL Prediction for Turbofan Engines (CMPASS dataset) 

**Key Words**: Remaining useful life; Time-varying operational conditions; Density-based clustering; Modified normalization method; Operational condition features; Turbofan engine data 

**Motivation：**
Time-varying operational conditions result in two main problems for RUL predictions: varying degradation rates and abrupt jumps in the amplitude of sensor readings. These two effects are addressed separately by introducing additionally operational condition features and a multi-operational condition-based normalization method. 

**Methods：**
- 1.DPCA-HDBSCAN for clustering operating conditions
- 2.additional operating condition features
- 3.modified normalization method
- 4.GRU 

**results:**
